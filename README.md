Ready to go frontend for [![easymern](https://img.shields.io/badge/easymern-brightgreen)](https://github.com/easymern)
stack.

- [![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-blue)](https://getbootstrap.com) very minimal use, you can easily swap it out for something else.
- [![Axios](https://img.shields.io/badge/Axios-blue)](#) Currently swapping this out for simple Fetch requests (just to remove the additional library. If you want Axios features, you can add it back in)
- [![Yup!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yup!-blue)](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form validation.
- [![React-hook-form](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReactHookForm-blue)](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) for form management.
